			<h1>Lab 3: File Structures - Task 3</h1>
		<p> This Lab is about how to structures files within HTML. How to put in headers, paragraphs, images, and being able
            to link to other HTML.
		  </p>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p> I found myself getting pretty frusterated with this assignment. I felt like it has been taking me SO long to complete
            each task. I couldn't figure out how to put in an image when it is in a folder. I kept trying but it would not load
            on the website, only showing a image icon.
		  </p>
          <h3>Results</h3>
		<p> I now have two HTML websites! Pretty neat I'd say. I could eventually use this to create an 
            online portfolio for my stage lighting designs.
