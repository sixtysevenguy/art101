					<h2>Challenge</h2>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We could get anything to work at first. We had the button made rigth but when it came to making it work correctly it wouldn't produce an output. 
						I found that linked the wrong API, I linked the whole site rather than one site that produced the random jokes.
